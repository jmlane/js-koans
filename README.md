# js-koans
Learn [ES6 JavaScript](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts) by contemplating [*koans*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) expressed within a suite of tests.

Inspired by [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).

# Objective
The goal of this project is to teach the changes to JavaScript in the ES6 specification through tests. As the test suite grows, it will be refactored into koan-style tests, containing failing or incomplete tests requiring student intervention to make pass.

Working through the koans incrementally should give students a taste of Test-Driven Development. Teaching TDD is not an explicit goal of this project, it is simply a pleasant side-effect from the test-centric nature of the koans.
